Custom Authentication is a way to authenticate users with your own custom authentication service like Auth0, Firebase Authentication etc.

For enabling this, you need [Create a Verifier](/custom-authentication/verifiers) from the **Custom Auth** section of the
[Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/home/customauth) with your desired configuration.

:::tip

If you want to know more about setting up a verifier and how to use it, please refer to the
[Custom Authentication Documentation](/custom-authentication).

## Installing Openlogin Adapter

---

Social logins in Web3Auth are enabled by the [`openlogin-adapter`](../openlogin). Natively, it is already present and preconfigured within the Plug
and Play SDK, but for custom configurations, you need to install the adapter package.

<OpenloginAdapterInstall />

## Configuring Openlogin Adapter

---

While instantiating the Openlogin Adapter, you can pass some configuration objects to the constructor. One of these configurations is the
`adapterSettings` configuration which enables you to make changes in the adapter, enabling you to do things like Whitelabeling and Custom
Authentication among other things.

:::tip

Checkout the [`openlogin-adapter`](../openlogin) API Reference for more details on different configurations you can pass for customisations.

:::

Further, the `loginConfig` parameter of the `adapterSettings` configuration helps us to customise the social logins. Since we're using the
`@web3auth/web3auth`, ie. the Plug and Play SDK, the `loginConfig` should be corresponding to the socials mentioned in the modal. This means you can
use your own authentication services for the following services:

`google` | `facebook` | `twitter` | `reddit` | `discord` | `twitch` | `apple` | `line` | `github` | `kakao` | `linkedin` | `weibo` | `wechat` |
`passwordless`

You can customise all or few of the social logins and other will remain default. You can also remove the ones you don't want using the whitelabeling
option.

:::caution

For a Custom JWT based authentication outside the services mention above you need to use the [`Web3Auth Core SDK`](../core) since the Web3Auth Modal
will not contain those custom logins you're looking for.

:::

#### `loginConfig`

The `loginConfig` parameter of `openlogin-adapter` contains the following properties:

<LoginConfig />

## Example

---

Since we're using the `@web3auth/web3auth` | ie. the Plug and Play SDK, the `loginConfig` should be corresponding to the socials mentioned in the
modal. Here, we're customising Google and Facebook to be custom verified, rest all other socials will be default.
